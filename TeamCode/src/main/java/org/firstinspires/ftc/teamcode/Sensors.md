I will be using a touch sensor, a distance color sensor (without using the distance portion of it, and a distance sensor.
Touch Sensor:
I will be using this to figure out when the robot hits the wall and it should be mounted at the front of the robot.
Distance color sensor:
This is to ensure the wall on the right is red but I will not be using the distance sensor because we already have a
 seperate one - but a second could be nice incase just to double check the distance.
This will be mounted on the right of the robot.
Distance Sensor:
This will be used to see how far the wall is, so first of all, when getting near the wall the robot can slow down and not
crash into the wall at full speed but then also to measure the two foot reversal the robot will have to do.
This will be mounted on the front of the robot
